"Main objective","Objective","Objective_1","8d827095-e68c-4abe-9aaa-de1ea47b8f6e","OBJ1","","To determine if there is a statistically significant relationship (overall Type 1 erroralpha=0.05) between the change in both the ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+ scores, and drug dose (0, 50 cm2 [54 mg], and 75 cm2 [81 mg])."
"Safety","Objective","Objective_2","7b8e6770-26a1-4abc-8b7c-24af1ad1e773","OBJ2","","To document the safety profile of the xanomeline TTS."
"Behaviour","Objective","Objective_3","4b17ecca-516c-4e5f-a820-70ec15d40ec5","OBJ3","","To assess the dose-dependent improvement in behavior. Improved scores on the Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X) will indicate improvement in these
areas."
"","Objective","Objective_4","367c603b-75e6-4c32-b23a-1e95893f16ac","OBJ4","","To assess the dose-dependent improvements in activities of daily living. Improved scores on the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) will indicate improvement in these areas (see Attachment LZZT.5)."
"","Objective","Objective_5","b75df1ce-671b-4b04-8d22-015325ef2489","OBJ5","","To assess the dose-dependent improvements in an extended assessment of cognition that integrates attention/concentration tasks. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-14 item Cognitive Subscale, hereafter referred to as ADAS-Cog (14), will be used for this assessment (see Attachment LZZT.2)."
