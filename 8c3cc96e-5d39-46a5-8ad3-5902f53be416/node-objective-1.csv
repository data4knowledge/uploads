"","Objective_2","Objective","OBJ2","8d76a099-6fb6-4966-866a-b94da73499a8","Safety","To document the safety profile of the xanomeline TTS."
"","Objective_3","Objective","OBJ3","9667618a-47f8-47b7-9732-4fd87ac78196","Behaviour","To assess the dose-dependent improvement in behavior. Improved scores on the Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X) will indicate improvement in these
areas."
"","Objective_4","Objective","OBJ4","c0d49c2a-9a7b-4503-ab17-9f8d723f66b7","","To assess the dose-dependent improvements in activities of daily living. Improved scores on the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) will indicate improvement in these areas (see Attachment LZZT.5)."
"","Objective_5","Objective","OBJ5","9905f6b5-e0a7-4252-ad7d-0cd463c8d943","","To assess the dose-dependent improvements in an extended assessment of cognition that integrates attention/concentration tasks. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-14 item Cognitive Subscale, hereafter referred to as ADAS-Cog (14), will be used for this assessment (see Attachment LZZT.2)."
