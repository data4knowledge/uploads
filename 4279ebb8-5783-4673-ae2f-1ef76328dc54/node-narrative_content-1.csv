<p><b>Summary of Study Design:</b></p>
<p>Study I8R-JE-IGBJ is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label, active comparator, single-dose, 2-treatment,
    2-period crossover study in Japanese patients with T1DM and patients with T2DM.</p>
<p><b>Treatment Arms and Planned Duration for an Individual Patient:</b></p>
<p>LY900018: Single 3-mg dose; nasal administration by study site personnel<br/>
    IMG (GlucaGen, Novo Nordisk A/S): Single 1-mg dose; IM injection by study site personnel</p>
<p>Patients will undergo a screening examination within 28 days prior to enrollment. Patients will be administered a
    single dose in Periods 1 and 2, which will be separated by a washout period of 3 to 14 days. Patients will return
    for a follow-up visit 26 to 30 days after the last study treatment.</p>
<p><b>Number of Patients:</b></p>
<p>Seventy five (<usdm:ref attribute=""maxValue"" id=""Range_2"" klass=""Range""></usdm:ref>) patients may be enrolled in order to have at
    least <usdm:ref attribute=""maxValue"" id=""Range_1"" klass=""Range""></usdm:ref> patients (at least <usdm:ref attribute=""maxValue"" id=""Range_3"" klass=""Range""></usdm:ref> patients with T1DM and <usdm:ref attribute=""maxValue"" id=""Range_5"" klass=""Range""></usdm:ref>
    T2DM, respectively) complete both periods with evaluable primary outcome. If patients discontinue from the study
    before completion of both periods with evaluable primary outcome for any reason, the patient may be replaced.
    Replacement
    should not occur beyond <usdm:ref attribute=""maxValue"" id=""Range_2"" klass=""Range""></usdm:ref> patients enrolled, if it is expected to have at
    least <usdm:ref attribute=""maxValue"" id=""Range_1"" klass=""Range""></usdm:ref> patients complete the study.</p>
<p><b>Statistical Analysis:</b></p>
<p>A total of 66 completers are required in the study in order to achieve the primary objective with at least 90%
    power using the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A treatment success rate of 98% for both treatments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A non-inferiority margin (NIM) of 10%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One-sided alpha level of 0.025</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A within-patient correlation of zero between 2 treatment visits</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary analysis will be a treatment comparison
    of the percentage of patients, including both T1DM and T2DM, who achieve treatment success. The percentage of
    patients who achieve treatment success within each treatment group and the difference in the percentages between the
    2
    treatment groups will be computed. A 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) will be obtained from the 1-sample mean of
    the paired differences in primary outcome (1=outcome observed; 0=outcome not observed) across 2 treatment visits.
    Non-inferiority of LY900018 will be declared if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI constructed on the difference
    in percentage (IMG - LY900018) is less than the NIM of 10%.</p>

"3.2.","NarrativeContent","NarrativeContent_7","Background","a7238858-6aa4-461b-9a77-f9d92a14b786","SECTION 3.2.","<div><p>Hypoglycemia is a common complication in all patients with T1DM and some patients with T2DM who use insulin to reduce blood glucose levels. Use of sulfonylurea and glinide by patients with T2DM may also cause hypoglycemia. Depending on the severity, hypoglycemia causes physical symptoms ranging from weakness, dizziness, and sweating progressing to blurred vision, behavioral changes, progressing to unconsciousness, seizures, and coma, and possibly to death (American Diabetes Association 2017). When emergency services are available in a timely manner, intravenous (IV) glucose supplementation is also an effective treatment. Glucagon for injection is a globally available product currently indicated for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia, and is another important treatment option outside of a clinical setting for people who try to rescue patients with severe hypoglycemia. However, for people without enough medical training, the multi-step reconstitution of glucagon and injection procedure would be complex and daunting with substantial risk of errors (Polonsky et al. 2016). Therefore the needle-free and easy-to-administer formulation of glucagon is desired for patients who have a risk of severe hypoglycemia related to anti-diabetes treatments. LY900018 is a powder formulation of synthetic human glucagon in a user-friendly, single-use, nasal dosing</p>
<p>device which delivers 3 mg glucagon powder. Patients do not need to inhale, as the drug is absorbed from the nasal cavity.</p>
<p>Three clinical trials using LY900018 have been completed in non-Japanese adults with T1DM and T2DM: Study IGBC, Study I8R-MC-IGBA (IGBA), and an actual use study (Study I8R-MC-B002 [B002]). Studies IGBC and IGBA demonstrated comparable safety and efficacy between 3 mg LY900018 and 1 mg injectable glucagon in reversing insulin-induced hypoglycemia in adult patients with T1DM only (Study IGBA) or patients with T2DM and T1DM (IGBC). Study B002 was an actual use study that evaluated the effectiveness of 3 mg LY900018 administered by a trained caregiver to patients with T1DM experiencing moderate to severe hypoglycemia in a real-world environment of work and home. Study B002 demonstrated that 96% of moderate to severe hypoglycemic events were resolved within 30 minutes. Finally, 2 trials were conducted in pediatric patients with T1DM: Study I8R-MC-IGBB (IGBB) and Study I8R-MC-B001 (B001). Studies IGBB and B001 demonstrated effectiveness in rescuing pediatric patients from hypoglycemia.</p>
<p>All adult diabetic patients in the 2 inpatient clinical trials (Studies IGBA and IGBC) underwent hypoglycemia induction through IV insulin under close clinical supervision and were administered either LY900018 or injectable glucagon.</p>
<p>Patients fully recovered from hypoglycemia without additional actions to increase glucose level. Specifically, in Study IGBC, at 30 minutes after glucagon dosing, 98.7% (74 out of 75 patients) of LY900018 and 100% (75 out of 75) of IMG-treated patients achieved treatment success (defined as an increase in PG to &gt;70 mg/dL or an increase of &gt;20 mg/dL from nadir). The nadir is defined as the minimum glucose measurement at the time of or within 10 minutes following glucagon administration. The LY900018-treated patient who did not meet the above criteria did achieve both PG &gt;70 mg/dL and an increase of &gt;20 mg/dL from nadir at 40 minutes after dosing. Furthermore, the mean time to treatment success in participants with nadir glucose &lt;50 mg/dL were 16 minutes in the LY900018 treatment arm and 13 minutes in the IMG treatment arm, respectively (Rickels et al. 2016).</p></div>"

<p>This study will expose patients to an insulin-induced hypoglycemia meant to simulate hypoglycemia in a controlled
  setting. The procedure of insulin-induced hypoglycemia targeting nadir glucose around 50 mg/dL is adopted from a
  previously completed trial, specifically Study IGBC, which demonstrated the safe use of this method. This is an
  inpatient procedure in which the patients will be under constant supervision of the clinical research unit (CRU) staff
  with frequent glucose monitoring. Safety provisions have been considered in that IV glucose will be administered if
  the patient experiences signs and symptoms of severe hypoglycemia and gauged to require intervention during the
  experimental procedure, at the discretion of the investigator.</p>
<p>Potential risks associated with LY900018, derived from the known risks of currently existing injected glucagon
  therapy and from the safety profile observed from clinical trials conducted for LY900018, include nausea, vomiting,
  allergic reactions, increased blood pressure (BP) and heart rate, headache, dysgeusia, and nasal or ocular events
  (Glucagon G Novo for Injection Package Insert, 2016; Glucagon G Novo for Injection Interview Form, 2015; GLUCAGON for
  Injection ITO Package Insert, 2016; GLUCAGON for Injection ITO Interview Form, 2016).</p>
<p><u>Nausea and Vomiting:</u> Glucagon therapy, including LY900018, may cause nausea and vomiting.</p>
<p><u>Allergic Reactions:</u> Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with glucagon
  therapy, including LY900018. Patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to injectable glucagon, or LY900018 or
  any of its excipients will be excluded from all clinical studies.</p>
<p><u>Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate:</u> Glucagon exerts positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. A temporary
  increase in both BP and heart rate may occur after the administration of glucagon, including LY900018.</p>
<p><u>Headache and Dysgeusia:</u> Use of LY900018 may cause headache and altered taste.</p>
<p><u>Nasal Symptoms:</u> Use of LY900018 may cause a variety of nasal symptoms, such as runny nose, stuffy nose, nasal
  discomfort, cough, and sneezing.</p>
<p><u>Ocular Symptoms:</u> Use of LY900018 may cause a variety of ocular symptoms, such as watery eyes, redness of eyes, and
  itchy eyes.</p>
<p>No additional potential risks of LY900018 were identified in preclinical safety pharmacology and toxicity studies
  (Reno et al. 2015).</p>
<p>More information about the known and expected benefits, risks, serious adverse events (SAEs), and reasonably
  anticipated adverse events (AEs) of LY900018 are to be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).</p>
<p>More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks of GlucaGen ® be found in the Summary of
  Product Characteristics (GlucaGen Summary of Product Characteristics, 2015).</p></div>"

  crossover study in Japanese patients with T1DM and T2DM. The study consists of a screening period; treatment period 1
  (Period 1); washout period; treatment period 2 (Period 2); follow-up period. Figure IGBJ.1 illustrates the study
  design. Prior to the study drug administration on Period 1 Day 1, patients will be randomly assigned to a treatment
  sequence (either LY900018 in Period 1 and IMG in Period 2, or vice versa).</p>
<p>Safety data will be reviewed after the first 6 patients (regardless of type of diabetes) are administered LY900018 in
  Period 2, and the remaining patients will be dosed after confirmation of the safety. The investigator and Lilly
  clinical research physician (CRP) or scientist will review available safety data, including AEs, SAEs, vital signs,
  electrocardiograms (ECGs), and safety laboratory tests, from these patients after they complete Period 2 Day 1. If no
  clinically significant safety findings for treatment or study procedure are noted, the remaining patients will be
  dosed.</p>
<p>In each treatment period, patients will undergo a procedure to induce hypoglycemia using IV insulin infusion and
  serial blood sampling will be conducted to monitor bedside PG for safety. The insulin infusion will be stopped once
  the PG level reaches &lt;60 mg/dL and approximately 5 minutes later patients will be administered either 3 mg LY900018
  or 1 mg IMG (GlucaGen). Serial blood sampling will be performed for glucagon (for pharmacokinetics [PK]) and PG (for
  pharmacodynamics [PD]) concentration measurements immediately before and up to 4 hours following the administration of
  glucagon. In each period, patients will remain in the CRU for at least 6 hours after glucagon administration. All
  patients will receive a carbohydrate-rich meal prior to discharge. Patients may stay longer as needed, at the
  discretion of the investigator.</p>

The study will be open label because the different administration routes (ie, intranasal and IM) cannot be blinded. The use of a crossover design allows each patient to serve as his or her own control, thereby reducing variability. The washout period of 3 to 14 days is considered sufficient based on the short half-life of LY900018 (t 1/2 = approximately 25 minutes). Since the critical role of glucagon in the treatment of severe hypoglycemia is to raise the PG level sufficiently to restore cognition to the point where oral carbohydrate can be ingested, treatment success is defined either as an increase in PG returning to normal level of ≥70 mg/dL or an increase of ≥20 mg/dL from the PG nadir within 30 minutes after receiving glucagon, without the patient receiving additional actions to increase glucose. It is believed that an expected PG nadir of approximately 50 mg/dL (approximately 5 minutes after stop of insulin infusion at 60 mg/dL) is low enough to generate clinical symptoms in most participants and is high enough to avoid impairment of consciousness. The primary analysis includes both patients with T1DM and T2DM since it is expected that the proportion of treatment success is similar between patients with T1DM and T2DM.</p></div>"

The 3-mg dose provides more consistent clinical efficacy compared to the 2-mg dose and is similarly well tolerated in both pediatric and adult patients.</p>
<p>The 1-mg dose of IMG is selected as the approved dose for the rescue treatment of hypoglycemia in Japan.</p>
<p>Based on LY900018 exposure, efficacy, and safety, the 3-mg dose was selected for the Phase 3 studies. Therefore, in the current study, the 3-mg LY900018 dose will be used to compare against 1 mg IMG.</p></div>"

  definitions:</p>
<b>Documented Glucose Alert Level (Level 1)</b>
<p>Plasma glucose ≤70 mg/dL</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><i>Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia:</i> with typical symptoms of hypoglycemia.</p>

<li>
<p><i>Documented unspecified hypoglycemia:</i> with no information about symptoms of hypoglycemia available. (This

</li>
</ul>
<b>Documented Clinically Significant Hypoglycemia (Level 2)</b>
<p>Similar criterion as for Level 1, except for threshold PG &lt;54 mg/dL</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Level 2 documented asymptomatic hypoglycemia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Level 2 documented unspecified hypoglycemia</i></p>
</li>
</ul>
<b>Severe Hypoglycemia (Level 3)</b>
<p>Patient had altered mental status and could not assist in their own care, was semiconscious or unconscious, or
  experienced coma with or without seizures, and the assistance of another person was to actively administer
  carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Plasma glucose
  measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of
  PG concentration to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low PG concentration (PG
  ≤70 mg/dL).</p>
<p><b>Other Hypoglycemia</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><i>Nocturnal hypoglycemia:</i>Any documented hypoglycemic event (including severe hypoglycemia) that occurs at
      night and presumably during sleep. This is captured as hypoglycemia that occurs between bedtime and waking. This definition
      is more useful than the commonly used approximately 00:00 to 06:00 definition which does not take patients'
      individual sleep times into consideration, and is consistent with the American Diabetes Association recommendations of
      reporting events that occur during sleep (ADA 2005). It is also important to collect the actual time when a hypoglycemic
      event occurred to allow further characterization of hypoglycemia timing (eg, to allow analysis of frequency of events
      occurring across a 24-hour clock). Nocturnal hypoglycemia may occur at severity Levels 1, 2, or 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Relative hypoglycemia (also referred to as pseudohypoglycemia [Seaquist et al. 2013]):</i> An event during which
      typical symptoms of hypoglycemia occur, that does not require the assistance of another person and is accompanied by PG
      &gt;70 mg/dL. The PG value of patients with chronically poor glycemic control can decrease so rapidly that patients may
      report symptoms of hypoglycemia before their PG concentration falls below 70 mg/dL. Events with PG ≤70 mg/dL
      should not be categorized as relative hypoglycemia. Evaluation and statistical analysis of this category is optional.
      However, if a patient reports a relative hypoglycemia event where assistance from another person was received or
      the patient experienced significant symptoms, the study team
      should clarify the circumstances to ensure the event is not a severe hypoglycemia event, and report it
      appropriately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia:</i> Symptoms of hypoglycemia were present, but PG measurement was not reported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Overall (or total) hypoglycemia:</i> This optional category combines most cases of hypoglycemia (documented
      hypoglycemia
      and probable symptomatic hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia). It does not include relative hypoglycemia.
      Nocturnal and severe hypoglycemia are special cases of documented or probable hypoglycemia. If an event of
      hypoglycemia falls into multiple subcategories, that event should only be counted once in the category of overall
      (or total) hypoglycemia.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hypoglycemia episodes will be recorded on specific CRF pages. Only severe hypoglycemic episodes will be reported
  separately as AEs. If a hypoglycemic event meets the criteria of severe, it needs to be recorded as serious in the CRF
  (that is, recorded as an SAE). In the case of a hypoglycemic event (other than severe), the actual glucose value, if
  measured, should be recorded in the CRF, with any treatments administered, and not be recorded as an AE. Cases of
  hypoglycemia may be treated with foods rich in carbohydrate such as fruit, juice, skimmed milk, or energy bars. All
  episodes of hypoglycemia that are determined by the investigator to constitute severe hypoglycemia according to the
  definition above should be reported as SAEs.</p></div>"

A PK sample may be collected at the follow-up immunogenicity assessment(s) if warranted and agreed upon between both the investigator and sponsor. Every attempt should be made to contact patients for the follow-up immunogenicity assessment; however, if patients are unwilling or unable to return for the visit, this is not considered a protocol violation.</p>
<p>Instructions for the collection and handling of blood samples will be provided by the sponsor. The actual date and time (24-hour clock time) of each sampling will be recorded.</p>
<p>Immunogenicity will be assessed by a validated assay designed to detect antidrug antibodies (ADA) in the presence of glucagon at a laboratory approved by the sponsor. Antibodies may be further characterized and/or evaluated for their ability to neutralize the activity of glucagon.</p>
<p>Samples will be retained for a maximum of 15 years after the last patient visit, or for a shorter period if local regulations and ethical review boards (ERBs) allow, at a facility selected by the sponsor. The duration allows the sponsor to respond to future regulatory requests related to LY900018. Any samples remaining after 15 years will be destroyed.</p></div>"
