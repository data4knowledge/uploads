"Safety","","Objective","OBJ2","e16f2f0d-ffa9-4c1b-bb93-b0e06e1d97ae","Objective_2","To document the safety profile of the xanomeline TTS."
"Behaviour","","Objective","OBJ3","bb2e82e7-a0c0-4301-9ee4-bfca20800657","Objective_3","To assess the dose-dependent improvement in behavior. Improved scores on the Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X) will indicate improvement in these
