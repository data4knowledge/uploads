"Rationale for Trial Design","NarrativeContent","<div><p>Previous studies of the oral formulation have shown that xanomeline tartrate may improve behavior and cognition. Effects on behavior are manifest within 2 to 4 weeks of initiation of treatment. The same studies have shown that 8 to 12 weeks are required to demonstrate effects on cognition and clinical global assessment. This study is intended to determine the acute and chronic effects of the TTS formulation in AD; for that reason, the study is of 26 weeks duration. Dosage specification has been made on the basis of tolerance to the xanomeline TTS in a clinical pharmacology study (H2Q-EW-LKAA), and target plasma levels as determined in studies of the oral formulation of xanomeline (H2Q-MC-LZZA).</p></div>","SECTION 4.2","4.2","NarrativeContent_15","8f6169b9-7127-4139-86b1-39917ae7a25a"
"Rationale for Comparator","NarrativeContent","<div><p>The parallel dosing regimen maximizes the ability to make direct comparisons between the treatment groups. The use of placebo allows for a blinded, thus minimally biased, study. The placebo treatment group is a comparator group for efficacy and safety assessment.</p><p>Two interim analyses are planned for this study. The first interim analysis will occur when 50% of the patients have completed Visit 8 (8 weeks). If required, the second interim analysis will occur when 50% of the patients have completed Visit 12 (24 weeks).</p></div>","SECTION 4.2.1","4.2.1","NarrativeContent_16","e6f6342c-4d53-4ab1-a7a1-37f28b07e26b"

"Selection of Trial Population","NarrativeContent","<div><p>For Lilly studies, the following definitions are used:</p>
<div>
  <div><strong>Screen</strong></div>
  <div>
    <p>Screening is the act of determining if an individual meets minimum requirements to become part of a pool of potential candidates for participation in a clinical study.</p>
    <p>In this study, <strong>screening</strong> will include asking the candidate preliminary questions (such as age and general health status) and conducting invasive or diagnostic procedures and/or tests (for example, diagnostic psychological tests, x-rays, blood draws). Patients will sign the consent at their screening visit, thereby consenting to undergo the screening procedures and to participate in the study if they qualify.</p>
  </div>  
</div>
<div>
  <div>To <strong>enter</strong></div>
  <div>
    <p>Patients <strong>entered</strong> into the study are those from whom informed consent for the study has been obtained. Adverse events will be reported for each patient who has <strong>entered</strong> the study, even if the patient is never assigned to a treatment group (<strong>enrolled</strong>).</p></div>
  </div>  
</div>
<div>
  <div>To <strong>enroll</strong></div>
  <div>
    <p>Patients who are enrolled in the study are those who have been assigned to a treatment group. Patients who are entered into the study but fail to meet criteria specified in the protocol for treatment assignment will not be enrolled in the study.</p></div>
  </div>  
</div>
<p>At Visit 1, patients who meet the enrollment criteria of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 10 to 23 (Attachment LZZT.6), Hachinski Ischemia Score â‰¤4 (Attachment LZZT.8), a physical exam, safety labs, ECG, and urinalysis, will proceed to Visit 2 and Visit 3. At Visit 3, patients whose CNS imaging and other pending labs from Visit 1 satisfy the inclusion criteria (Section 3.4.2.1) will be enrolled in the study. Approximately 300 patients with a diagnosis of probable mild to moderate AD will be enrolled in the study.</p></div>","SECTION 5.1","5.1","NarrativeContent_22","298fa5c8-886a-48c6-91db-93ac98b9edc5"
