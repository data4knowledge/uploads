"StudyVersion_1","1","<p>Nasal glucagon (LY900018) is a powder formulation of human glucagon for the rescue treatment of hypoglycemia packaged
  in a user-friendly, single-use, nasal dosing device that delivers 3 mg glucagon powder for absorption through the
  nasal mucosa. The glucagon component of LY900018 is a synthetic single-chain, 29-amino-acid polypeptide identical to
  human glucagon. LY900018 is being developed for the rescue treatment of hypoglycemia.</p>
<p>Currently, glucagon in a liquid form lacks physical and chemical stability; thus, marketed products require
  reconstitution of glucagon powder before the product can be administered through intramuscular (IM) injection.
  LY900018 combines stable, synthetic glucagon and a nasal dosing device that for effective use obviates reconstitution,
  injection, and moreover, patient inhalation. Because of these advantages, LY900018 may offer a significant improvement
  in the treatment of severe hypoglycemia occurring outside of the hospital setting.</p>
<p>The aim of this study is to compare LY900018 with IM glucagon (IMG), a currently approved product that requires
  reconstitution prior to administration through IM injection, in Japanese patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)
  and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who achieve treatment success during controlled insulin-induced
  hypoglycemia. Treatment success is defined as an increase in plasma glucose (PG) to ≥70 mg/dL or an increase of ≥20
  mg/dL from the PG nadir within 30 minutes after receiving glucagon, without the patient receiving additional
  treatments to increase PG. The nadir is defined as the minimum PG measurement at the time of or within 10 minutes
  following glucagon administration.</p>","StudyVersion","07905bd9-73cf-4bf4-ab28-4fa88e4ff87a"
