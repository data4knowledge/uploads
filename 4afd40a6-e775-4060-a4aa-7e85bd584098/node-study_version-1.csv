The study will specifically evaluate the effects of 2 different ALXN1840 doses as well as the duration of treatment on copper balance to further elucidate the dose response of “decoppering” versus “maintenance” dose in participants with WD.</p>
<p>The secondary aim of the study is to characterize the steady-state absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME; mass balance) of total molybdenum which is a surrogate measure of ALXN1840 disposition in participants with WD.</p>
<p>ALXN1840 contains the active anion tetrathiomolybdate and has been shown to cause negative copper balance when administered to healthy animals as well as decopper the liver in animal models of WD. In Study WTX101-201, which assessed the safety and efficacy of ALXN1840 in participants with WD, ALXN1840 demonstrated enhanced copper control as measured by reduced plasma non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) corrected (NCCcorrected ) for the stable tetrathiomolybdate- copper -albumin tripartite complex (TPC).</p>
<p>Depletion of copper by ALXN1840 has been shown to occur primarily through fecal elimination in both healthy and WD animal models. In this study, copper balance will be calculated as the difference between measured copper input in food and drink and measured copper output in urine and feces. This method is classically considered the most objective measure of decoppering ability with a decoppering agent able to drive a net negative copper balance.</p>
<p>As part of the secondary objective, to confirm that ALXN1840 steady state is adequately characterized by the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK), a molybdenum mass balance assessment will be performed at predicted steady state for the 15 mg/day and 30 mg/day doses: if steady state is achieved, molybdenum(out) will equal molybdenum(in). This approach may also detect potential accumulation in the liver or other tissues of participants with WD.</p>","2"
