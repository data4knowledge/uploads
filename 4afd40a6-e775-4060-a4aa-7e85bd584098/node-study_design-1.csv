"The main design for the study","StudyDesign_1","","Main Design","StudyDesign","3742f736-5d60-49c5-a548-4031eae890b9","<p>The study is designed as an open-label exploratory study to provide a descriptive assessment of copper balance in participants with WD, the target population for ALXN1840 therapy. The study is being conducted as a repeat-dose study to assess the effect of duration of ALXN1840 treatment and the effects of intra-patient dose increase on copper and molybdenum balance in participants with WD. The intra-patient dose escalation schedule is similar to that employed in the current Phase 3 Study WTX101-301. The similar schedule was chosen to characterize the decoppering effects expected early with treatment. This study is designed to supplement the mechanism of action study in healthy participants (Study ALXN1840-HV-108). While healthy participants are expected to be adequate to assess the mechanism of action of ALXN1840, characterization of copper balance in the WD population will help to understand if there are differences in the magnitude of effect between the 2 populations as this may be important to understand the doses that may support a net neutral versus a net negative copper balance. Limited nonclinical data on copper elimination with tetrathiomolybdate suggested copper excretion may be at least maintained or increased with repeated dosing (refer to the current IB).</p>
<p>Therefore, the duration of the study and multiple collection periods will better characterize the pattern of copper elimination over time. Such information may be helpful in understanding the decoppering and maintenance phases.</p>
<p>As the study involves intensive diet control and sampling, the study is planned to be conducted in a small number of participants with WD who will be admitted to a CRU for 2 inpatient periods. Inpatient Period 1 includes a baseline and initial 15 mg/day collection period during the accumulation phase followed by an Outpatient Period; Inpatient Period 2 with a second collection period to support analysis of copper balance at 15 mg/day steady state and a 30 mg/day accumulation and steady state.</p>
<p>During the Outpatient Period, participants will be encouraged to remain on a copper-controlled diet; however, to avoid confounding, a diet equilibration period is included in each study period. Overall, collection periods are a minimum of 3 days and as long as 15 days (which will be subdivided for analyses). Collection periods of at least 3 days were used to help minimize the impact of day-to-day variability on measurements. In addition, the time period for analysis will take into consideration the average bowel transit of approximately 40 hours (male: 33 hours; female: 47 hours) (Camilleri, 1986; Metcalf, 1987). Because the periods are of different lengths, the study will calculate mean daily copper balance.</p>
<p>While the primary endpoint for the study is an assessment of net copper balance, measurement of a pretreatment copper baseline will be helpful to understand the magnitude of effect of ALXN1840. To assess the copper baseline during the Inpatient Run-in Period, participants will be discontinued from their chelator therapy for approximately 4 days prior to initiating ALXN1840. During this period, participants will be maintained on a copper-controlled diet to minimize risk to the participants. In the Phase 3 study ALXN1840-WD-301, participants discontinue their chelator approximately 48 hours prior to initiation of ALXN1840 without reported complications. Among participants who discontinue chelator due to intolerance or noncompliance, the time from chelator discontinuation to the onset or worsening of symptoms varies from as little as 1 or 2 weeks to as long as months or years (Scheinberg, 1987). To prevent confounding of the study results, participants must be off zinc therapy for a minimum of 21 days prior to Day 1 because zinc works through upregulation of metallothionein (MT) in enterocytes resulting in elevation of fecal copper excretion. Previously, reports in the literature suggest that it can take up to 3 weeks or longer for zinc treatment to have an efficacious effect on copper balance (Brewer, 1983), so a delayed time to reversal of this effect could also occur. However, the physiologic turnover of human gastrointestinal epithelial cells is 3 - 5 days (Darwich, 2014); therefore, the inhibitory effect of zinc on intestinal copper absorption is expected to be minimal 21 days after discontinuation of zinc.</p>
<p>Following ALXN1840 administration, the active drug moiety tetrathiomolybdate rapidly binds copper to form TPC, mostly in the liver and blood, and presents as such in the systemic circulation. If TPC is not rapidly formed, tetrathiomolybdate spontaneously undergoes serial hydrolysis to form molybdate, the most common form of nutrient molybdenum, and is excreted in the urine. Total molybdenum concentration has been measured as a surrogate of ALXN1840 PK; however, total molybdenum concentration cannot distinguish whether the molybdenum is protein bound (mostly as TPC), free active drug as ALXN1840, intermediate hydrolysis products, or molybdate. To better characterize the amount of non-TPC-bound drug and its unbound degradation products, plasma PUF-molybdenum has also been measured, which represents the free parent drug (ALXN1840), short-lived intermediate hydrolysis products, and molybdate, which may have originated from the tetrathiomolybdate or from food intake as a micronutrient. Total molybdenum PK and free molybdenum PK serve as surrogate measures of ALXN1840 PK. To better characterize the ADME of ALXN1840, the PK of both total molybdenum and PUF-molybdenum will be characterized and described.</p>
<p>This study is designed to provide an extensive assessment of copper and molybdenum balance over the first 40 days of treatment with ALXN1840 and support a more robust understanding of the effects of duration of treatment and dose of ALXN1840 on copper balance. Half-life estimates for total molybdenum in Study WTX101-201 were reported to be approximately 24 hours at steady state on Days 84 and 168, while in healthy participants, total molybdenum half-life was measured closer to 51 hours. With a half-life within this range, the sample collection periods include assessment of copper and molybdenum balance both during accumulation and at steady state for both the 15 mg/day and 30 mg/day doses. The study will include both intake and output collection as well as PK and copper assessments (ie, ceruloplasmin-bound copper and labile bound copper [LBC]) to inform the relationship between balance measurements and copper and molybdenum levels in the blood.</p>
<p>Finally, preclinical data from ALXN1840 ADME study suggest the potential for molybdenum accumulation in the liver of participants with WD; therefore, an assessment of molybdenum balance will help determine whether steady state has been reached as defined by a molybdenum balance of neutral during the collection period. Because molybdenum is a necessary micronutrient and serves as a cofactor for a number of enzymes and may exist in intracellular stores, small variations in molybdenum balance could be due to molybdate rather than ALXN1840.</p>"
