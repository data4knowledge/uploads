  <li>
    [3a] women of childbearing potential who are abstinent (if this is complete
    abstinence, as their preferred and usual lifestyle) or in a same sex
    relationship (as part of their preferred and usual lifestyle) must agree to
    either remain abstinent or stay in a same sex relationship without sexual
    relationships with males. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation,
    symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence just for
    the duration of a trial, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
    contraception.
  </li>
  <li>
    [3b] otherwise, women of childbearing potential participating must agree to use
    one highly effective method (less than 1% failure rate) of contraception, or a
    combination of 2 effective methods of contraception for the entirety of the
    study.

      <li>[A] women of childbearing potential participating must test negative for
        pregnancy prior to initiation of treatment as indicated by a negative serum

        pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to exposure.</li>
      <li>[B] either one highly effective method of contraception or a combination
        of 2 effective methods of contraception will be used. The patient may
        choose to use a double barrier method of contraception. Barrier protection
        methods without concomitant use of a spermicide are not a reliable or
        acceptable method. Thus, each barrier method must include use of a
        spermicide. It should be noted that the use of male and female condoms
        as a double barrier method is not considered acceptable due to the high
        failure rate when these methods are combined.</li>
